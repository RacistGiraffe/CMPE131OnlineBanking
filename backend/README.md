*This is the entire project with backend touches*

Backend almost finished, just a few syntax errors. The login system works perfectly fine. Some HTML files got their styling connected to a  seperate CSS file.

*Frontend needs to implement two new html stylings for home.php and accounsettings.php
    + please indicate if data from database is needed to be shown so I can implement that

All folders in here are required to run the code. 

For this to run locally on your computer: 

1) Create a folder to place all these files in htdocs in your XAMPP folder. 
2) Open XAMPP application and start Apache and MySQL
3) Head to localhost:/yourFolderName/header.php

*NOTE*
As of 11/28/2018, the database is automatically created if not already existing ||: weird syntax errors stopping from balances working properly

Temp text files serve only one purpose: to allow for the creation of folders.
