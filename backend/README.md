*This is the entire project with backend touches*

Backend isn't completely finished yet. The login system works perfectly fine. Some HTML files got their styling connected to a  
seperate CSS file.

All folders in here are required to run the code. 

For this to run locally on your computer: 

1) Create a folder to place all these files in htdocs in your XAMPP folder. 
2) Open XAMPP application and start Apache and MySQL
3) Head to localhost:/yourFolderName/header.php

*NOTE*
As of 11/13/2018, you will need to manually create your own database "onlinebanking" with table "users" in PHPmyAdmin
    --> consists of five columns idUsers, uidUsers, emailUsers, pwdUsers, balanceUsers
// Will be fixed once balances have been implemented

Temp text files serve only one purpose: to allow for the creation of folders.
